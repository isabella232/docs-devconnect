<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install <%= vars.product_full %> on your <%= vars.bosh_runtime %> as a
BOSH Release.


## <a id="Overview"></a> Overview

To install <%= vars.product_short %> on your <%= vars.bosh_runtime %> you must configure a BOSH
manifest and variable file for <%= vars.product_short %>.
After you configure the files, you must upload and deploy the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Release
to your <%= vars.bosh_runtime %>.

To install <%= vars.product_short %> on your <%= vars.bosh_runtime %>:

1. [Create the Deployment Manifest](#manifest)
1. [Create a Variables Configuration File](#variables)
1. [Upload and Deploy the <%= vars.product_short %> BOSH Release](#deploy)

## <a id="prereq"></a> Prerequisites

Before you install <%= vars.product_short %>, you must have:

- Followed the procedures in [Preparing <%= vars.product_full %> for Deployment](./preparing.html).
- A <%= vars.bosh_runtime %> deployed.
- Access to the <%= vars.product_full %> product on
[<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/developer-connect/).


## <a id="manifest"></a> Create the Deployment Manifest

The <%= vars.product_full %> team maintains a sample manifest that you can use as a starting point.

To generate the sample manifest:

1. Download [YTT](https://get-ytt.io/).

1. Clone the [<%= vars.product_short %> Deployment Repository](https://github.com/pivotal/devconnect-deployment).

1. To run `ytt` on the `manifest` directory, run:

    ```
    ytt -f manifest/ > MANIFEST-FILE
    ```


### <a id="installing-devconnect-without-tas"></a> Register an Identity Provider with the <%= vars.product_short %> UAA

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the User Account and Authentication (UAA) release. For more information, see
[uaa Release](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release?all=1) in the BOSH documentation.

To configure the UAA with an identity provider (IdP):

1. Follow the steps in the
[documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/blob/develop/docs/uaa.md) in GitHub.
You will need to modify the UAA Release configuration in the manifest file you generated in the
[Create the Deployment Manifest](#manifest) procedure above.


### <a id="installing-devconnect-without-tas"></a> Installing <%= vars.product_short %> without <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

The sample manifest assumes the <%= vars.bosh_runtime %> you are deploying <%= vars.product_short %>
in has <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> installed, but this is not necessary.
To complete the installation without <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>:

<!-- TODO: write instructions on how to configure a separate routing release. -->

## <a id="variables"></a> Create a Variables Configuration File

The sample manifest refers to variables throughout that must be populated with values.
A sample variables file exists in `manifest/sample-variables.yml`.
You can use the sample as a template for your own configuration.

```
cp manifest/sample-variables.yml VARIABLES-FILE
```
